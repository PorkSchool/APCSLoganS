In a short response of three to five sentences, 
share a portion of your results from the trials you ran for the HeadsOrTails program. 
Specifically report on the five trials using an unbiased (fair)
coin with 100 flips and the five trials using an unbiased (fair) 
coin with 10,000 flips. Which simulation results do you think best 
reflect the real world? Explain your answer.


The trials I ran with 100 coin flips had an average of 28 heads and 72 tails.
The trials I ran with 10,000 coin flips had an average of 4990 Heads and 5010 tails.
I think the trial that shows the most accurate real world would be the 10,000 flips. This is because the more iterations
of the program that you run, the more data you get.
